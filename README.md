# power_grids_data
In this repo there is the main implementation for the joint work with A. Zocca and G. Bet, "Generating Synthetic Power Grids using Exponential Random Graph Models". In "Example.ipynb" you will find a brief notebook with an example of the full generation procedure for a test grid (118_ieee).
