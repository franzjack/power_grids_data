# power_grids_ERG
In this repo there is the main implementation for the joint work with A. Zocca and G. Bet, "Generating Synthetic Power Grids using Exponential Random Graph Models". In "Example_PG_ERG.ipynb" you will find a brief notebook with an example of the full generation procedure for a test grid (118_ieee).
